# How directory is composed ?

As you can see in exemple you have 3 main directories :

* Assets : in this folder you can put your gameplay components, your textures, your 3D models...
* Library : in this folder will be placed all extensions that use KapEngine and need compiling before compiling your game
* Package : in this folder will be placed all extension that use KapEngine but do not need compiling before compiling your game

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not respect this folders storage, your game could not compile.
{% endhint %}
